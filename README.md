# tcpi.ahk
> Twitch Channel Points Integration AutoHotkey script

Redeeming Channel Points with `tcpi.ahk` can do the following things:
* Trigger key input that can be used to sabotage your gameplay (e.g. throw a grenade for you)
* Trigger hotkeys in your broadcasting software for activating/deactivating sources or changing scenes
* Play your custom audio files
* Play user-entered text-to-speech in your desired language

## Prerequisites
* <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/" target="_blank">AutoHotkey</a> is a free, open-source scripting language, initially aimed at providing keyboard shortcuts or hotkeys. Having AutoHotkey installed is required for the use of `tcpi.ahk`.
* [Chatty](https://chatty.github.io/) is a free chat software specifically made for Twitch, in the spirit of a classic IRC client. Chatty's chatlogs are used to parse the Channel Point Redemptions for `tcpi.ahk`.

## Instructions
1. Open the `tcpi.ahk` file in a text editor (like notepad.exe).
2. Detailed instructions on the use of the script are found inside of the file itself. Reading an AutoHotkey script like this might not be straight-forward, but you will have to edit this file anyway, so bear with it for a moment. For easier reading, please reference the syntax highlighted version on GitHub or [myian.tv](https://myian.tv/tcpi).
3. Set up AutoHotkey and Chatty as specified in the instructions.
4. Change the variables in the file to match your environment.
5. Customize your rewards. Refer to the examples given in the file as well as the [AutoHotkey documentation](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/KeyList.htm) for a list of keys.
6. Save the file. Make sure the file extension is still `.ahk`. 
7. Double-click the file to run it.
8. Happy trial & error!
